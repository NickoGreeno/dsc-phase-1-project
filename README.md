# Phase 1 Project Summary

The following is all the steps I took in preparing this project.

## Understanding My Data

In order to understand what the data had in relation to my business goal, framing a Microsoft media library, I had to
first understand what it represented. I quickly found that there were measures to rate movies, based on gross and averagerating, 
which I could tie to other variables like genre to inspect correlation. Where the data came from was also important. Coming 
from the likes of Box Office Mojo and IMDb, it could be trusted for confident speculations.

## Preparing My Data

After seeing what the data represented, I had to clean data for it to made into interpretable information and visuals. 
It came down to clearing null values, merging data frames, and cutting extremes. With that, my data was prepared to be
professionally analyzed.

## Drawing Conclusions

At this point I used descriptive statistics to draw conclusions. Then I folded that data into graphs to be interpreted, and 
to draw conclusions. Those visuals were also also useful in communicating my findings.

## Recommending Business Solutions

The last part of the project was to communicate my findings to tie them into concrete business recommendations. The act of
simmering all of the work done in the project into digestible pieces of information for non-technical stakeholders.
